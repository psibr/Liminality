# PSIBR.Liminality

>Transition library by a transfem so you know it's good

PSIBR.Liminality is a basic state machine modelling library that handles a lot of organization descisions for you, but doesn't try to boil the ocean. 

Bring your own state storage and fancy behaviors.


## Cloning and Building

git clone https://github.com/psibr/liminality.git
cd liminality
